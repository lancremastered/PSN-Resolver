PSN Resolver – The Best IP Finder and IP Puller for PS4

PSN Resolver are IP resolvers that convert PSN usernames to IP addresses and vice versa. The technology works the same as DNS, where as your browser is automatically translating an IP to it’s correlating domain name. Now in order for a PSN resolver to work, there need to be a central server or database with the whole PSN network to be accessible, however due to security concerns, Sony won’t give public access to such information and thereby makes it impractical to resolve all gamer-tags/PSN usernames.

By stating the above, you have probably come across websites that claim to resolve PSN usernames, Skype or even Discord. But by the time you spent 5 to 10 minutes testing numerous usernames, you will notice that none of them resolved to any IP address. That’s because the web developer created their own database (not accessing Sony’s data) and require users (such as yourself) to build that database from scratch with gamer-tags, IP addresses etc. and ultimately rendering it a complete waste of time.

Now that we cleared up a few topics about a PSN resolver. Lets dive into how we can get real IP addresses from Playstation whilst playing or connected to an in-game party chat in real time.
